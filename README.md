## Comments

Scriptor supports Ghost native or Disqus comments.

To enable Ghost native comments:

2. Select the suitable option from the Commenting dropdown.
3. Save changes.

To enable Disqus commenting:

1. Navigate to Settings → Design in your Ghost admin.
2. Expand the Post section.

4. Save changes.

## Social Links

To add Facebook and X (Twitter) links, navigate to **Settings** → **General**, click **Expand** next to **Social accounts** and enter the URLs of your Facebook and X (Twitter) profiles. Additional social links (Instagram, Bluesky, and LinkedIn) can be added via custom settings in Ghost admin.

If you want to add some other social media links, you can add them manually in the `footer.hbs` file located in the `partials` folder of the theme. For instance, if you want to add the link to your GitHub account, add the following code inside the `<div>` element with the class of `footer-social`:

```
<a href="URL_TO_YOUR_GITHUB_PROFILE" target="_blank" rel="noopener" aria-label="GitHub">
    {{> "icons/github"}}
</a>
```

To see the available icons, please check the `icons` folder of the theme located in the `partials` folder.

## Translation

The **Scriptor** theme is fully translatable. You can find the default file in the `locales` folder. Copy `locales/en.json` to `locales/[language_code].json`. The `language_code` must be replaced with a valid code. You can edit the renamed translation file with any plain text editor.

To find more information on how to translate the theme, check [Ghost documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/themes/helpers/translate/).

## Development

To start developing locally, you need to have Ghost installed on your machine. Please follow installation instructions provided in [Ghost documentation](https://ghost.org/docs/install/local/).

The theme stylesheet is located in `/assets/css/`.
